    "#### Import Necessary Modules\n",
    "Various essential modules are imported to facilitate different tasks in the project:\n",
    "- **Logging**: For tracking events and debugging.\n",
    "- **Requests**: To make HTTP requests to APIs.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **URL Parsing**: To handle and manipulate URLs.\n",
    "- **Concurrent Futures**: To manage asynchronous tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configure Logging\n",
    "Detailed logging is configured to help with development and debugging. The logging level is set to `INFO`, and a consistent format is applied to all log messages to ensure readability and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Credentials\n",
    "API credentials for Amadeus and OpenWeather are hard-coded for simplicity. These keys should be retrieved from environment variables in a production environment to enhance security:\n",
    "- **Amadeus API**: Includes both the API key and secret.\n",
    "- **OpenWeather API**: Contains the API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API URLs\n",
    "A structured dictionary is used to store the various Amadeus API endpoints. This organization aids in managing multiple API services, including:\n",
    "- **Base URL**: The main endpoint for the Amadeus API.\n",
    "- **Flight Offers Search**: For searching flight offers.\n",
    "- **Flight Inspiration Search**: To get inspiration for flights based on various criteria.\n",
    "- **Airport and City Search**: To retrieve airport and city details.\n",
    "- **City Search**: To find cities using specific keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenWeather API Key\n",
    "The OpenWeather API key is similarly hard-coded. For production, it is advisable to use environment variables to secure this sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging Configuration\n",
    "An informational log message confirms the successful setup of API configurations for both Amadeus and OpenWeather. This step ensures that the initial setup has been executed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location Cache\n",
    "A cache is initialized to store location details, which helps reduce redundant API calls. This caching mechanism enhances the efficiency and performance of the application by avoiding repeated requests for the same data.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### AmadeusAPI Class\n",
    "The `AmadeusAPI` class manages interactions with the Amadeus travel API. It handles user authentication, manages API requests, and implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for robust error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**:\n",
    "  The class is initialized with the API key, API secret, and base URL. It sets up attributes for storing the access token and its expiration time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  - `authenticate()`: Authenticates with the Amadeus API to retrieve and store the access token. Implements retry logic with exponential backoff upon failure.\n",
    "  - `request_with_retry(url, params=None, method='get', retries=3)`: Sends a request to the Amadeus API using the specified HTTP method, handling retries and rate limiting.\n",
    "  - `is_authenticated()`: Checks if the client is currently authenticated by verifying the presence of an access token and its validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authentication Method\n",
    "The `authenticate` method retrieves the access token from the Amadeus API, handling retries with exponential backoff in case of failures. If successful, it logs a success message and returns the access token. In case of errors, it logs appropriate error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Request with Retry Method\n",
    "The `request_with_retry` method sends a request to the Amadeus API, handling retries and rate limiting. It supports both 'GET' and 'POST' methods, and includes detailed logging for each attempt, including exponential backoff for retries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health Check Function\n",
    "The `check_amadeus_api_health` function performs a health check on the Amadeus API by requesting flight offers from Frankfurt to Paris for a specific date. This check ensures that the API is responsive and functioning correctly by validating the retrieval of flight data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Function\n",
    "The `test_amadeus_api_health` function tests the health of the Amadeus API by performing an authentication and then running a health check. It logs the status of the API health based on the test results.\n",

    "- **Methods**:\n",
    "  - `get_average_daily_temperature(latitude, longitude)`: Retrieves the average daily temperature based on geographical coordinates for the next 5 days. It sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and processes the response to calculate the average temperature.\n",

    "#### get_average_daily_temperature Method\n",
    "This method constructs the URL and parameters for the API request based on the provided latitude and longitude. It sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and raises an error if the request fails. It extracts temperature data from the response and calculates the average temperature if data is found. Logs detailed messages about the success or failure of the request and temperature calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Health Check Function\n",
    "The `check_open_weather_api_health` function performs a health check on the OpenWeather API by requesting average daily temperature data for a specific location. This function simulates a user query to validate API responsiveness and operational status using the New York City coordinates.\n",

    "#### Test Function\n",
    "The `test_open_weather_api_health` function tests the health of the OpenWeather API by creating an instance of `OpenWeatherAPI`, setting the API key, and then using it to check API health. It logs the status of the API health based on the test results.\n",
